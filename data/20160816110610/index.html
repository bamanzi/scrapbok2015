  <h2>Welcome to Mercurial: The Definitive Guide</h2>

  <p>This is the online home of the book “Mercurial: The
    Definitive Guide”.  
    It was published in 2009 by O'Reilly Media.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial">Mercurial</a> is a
    fast, lightweight source control management system
    designed for easy and efficient handling of very large distributed
    projects.  My book tells you what it is, why you should care, and
    how you can use it effectively.</p>

  <h2>Read it online</h2>
