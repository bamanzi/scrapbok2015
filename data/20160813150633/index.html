<h3 class="section">4.2 Types And Syntax Of Ignore Lists</h3>

<p>If you put Perl regular expressions, one per line, in a
<samp><span class="file">.stow-local-ignore</span></samp> file within any top level package directory,
in which case any file or directory within that package matching any
of these regular expressions will be ignored.  In the absence of this
package-specific ignore list, Stow will instead use the contents of
<samp><span class="file">~/.stow-global-ignore</span></samp>, if it exists.  If neither the
package-local or global ignore list exist, Stow will use its own
built-in default ignore list, which serves as a useful example of the
format of these ignore list files:

</p><pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     # Comments and blank lines are allowed.
     
     RCS
     .+,v
     
     CVS
     \.\#.+       # CVS conflict files / emacs lock files
     \.cvsignore
     
     \.svn
     _darcs
     \.hg
     
     \.git
     \.gitignore
     
     .+~          # emacs backup files
     \#.*\#       # emacs autosave files
     
     ^/README.*
     ^/LICENSE.*
     ^/COPYING
</pre></pre>
   <p>Stow first iterates through the chosen ignore list (built-in, global,
or package-local) as per above, stripping out comments (if you want to
include the ‘<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>’ symbol in a regular expression, escape it with a
blackslash) and blank lines, placing each regular expressions into one
of two sets depending on whether it contains the ‘<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>’ forward
slash symbol.

   </p><p>Then in order to determine whether a file or directory should be
ignored:

     </p><ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Stow calculates its path relative to the top-level package directory,
prefixing that with ‘<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>’.  If any of the regular expressions
containing a ‘<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>’ <em>exactly</em><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> match
a subpath<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> of this relative path, then the file or
directory will be ignored.

     </li><li>If none of the regular expressions containing a ‘<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>’ match in the
manner described above, Stow checks whether the
<em>basename</em><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a> of the file or directory matches
<em>exactly</em> against the remaining regular expressions which do not
contain a ‘<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>’, and if so, ignores the file or directory.

     </li><li>Otherwise, the file or directory is not ignored.
        </li></ol>

<!-- N.B. if you change the examples below, please also consider -->
<!-- updating test_examples_in_manual() in t/ignore.t. -->
   <p>For example, if a file <samp><span class="file">bazqux</span></samp> is in the <samp><span class="file">foo/bar</span></samp>
subdirectory of the package directory, Stow would use
‘<samp><span class="samp">/foo/bar/bazqux</span></samp>’ as the text for matching against regular
expressions which contain ‘<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>’, and ‘<samp><span class="samp">bazqux</span></samp>’ as the text for
matching against regular expressions which don't contain ‘<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>’. 
Then regular expressions ‘<samp><span class="samp">bazqux</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">baz.*</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">.*qux</span></samp>’,
‘<samp><span class="samp">bar/.*x</span></samp>’, and ‘<samp><span class="samp">^/foo/.*qux</span></samp>’ would all match (causing the
file to be ignored), whereas ‘<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">baz</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">qux</span></samp>’, and
‘<samp><span class="samp">o/bar/b</span></samp>’ would not (although ‘<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>’ would cause its parent
directory to be ignored and prevent Stow from recursing into that
anyway, in which case the file <samp><span class="file">bazqux</span></samp> would not even be
considered for stowing).

   </p><p>As a special exception to the above algorithm, any
<samp><span class="file">.stow-local-ignore</span></samp> present in the top-level package directory
is <em>always</em> ignored, regardless of the contents of any ignore
list, because this file serves no purpose outside the stow directory.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Exact matching means the
regular expression is anchored at the beginning and end, in contrast
to unanchored regular expressions which will match a substring.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> In this context, “subpath” means a contiguous
subset of path segments; e.g for the relative path
<samp><span class="file">one/two/three</span></samp>, there are six valid subpaths: <samp><span class="file">one</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">two</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">three</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">one/two</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">two/three</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">one/two/three</span></samp>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> The “basename” is the name of the file or
directory itself, excluding any directory path prefix - as returned by
the <samp><span class="command">basename</span></samp> command.</p>
