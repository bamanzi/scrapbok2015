<p>I accidentally stumbled upon something yesterday that I felt like
sharing, which fell squarely into the "why the hell didn't I know about this
before?" category. In this post, I'll describe how to manage
the various configuration files in your GNU/Linux home directory (aka 
"dotfiles" like <code>.bashrc</code>) using GNU Stow. </p>

<p>The difficulty is that it would be helpful to manage one's
configuration files with a version control system like Git, Mercurial
or Bazaar, but many/most dotfiles reside at the top-level of your home
directory, where it wouldn't be a good idea to initialize a VCS
repository. Over time I've come across various programs which aim to
manage this for you by keeping all the files in a subdirectory and
then installing or linking them into their appropriate places. None of
those programs ever really appealed to me.  They would require a ton
of dependencies (like Ruby and a ton of libraries for it) or they
would require me to remember how to use them, which is difficult when
really for such a task you rarely use the program.</p>

<p>Lately I've been using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow">GNU Stow</a> to manage
programs I install from source to <code>/usr/local/</code>. Basically, in this typical
usage, you install locally built packages to
<code>/usr/local/stow/${PKGNAME}-{PKGVERSION}</code> and then from <code>/usr/local/stow/</code> you run
<code># stow ${PKGNAME}-${PKGVERSION}</code> and the program generates symbolic links to
all the programs' files into the appropriate places under <code>/usr/local/</code>. Then,
when you uninstall a program via Stow, you don't have to worry about any stray
files that you or a provide Makefile may have missed. It also makes handling
alternate versions of a program quite easy (i.e. when I'm experimenting with
different configurations of <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> or
<a href="http://st.suckless.org/">st</a>).</p>

<p>Some time ago I happened across a mailing list posting where someone described
using Stow to manage the installation of their dotfiles. I didn't pay much
attention to it but my brain must have filed it away for later. Yesterday I
decided to give it a try and I have to say that it is so much more convenient
than those other dedicated dotfile-management programs, even if it wasn't an
immediately obvious option.</p>

<p>The procedure is simple. I created the <code>${HOME}/dotfiles</code> directory and then
inside it I made subdirectories for all the programs whose cofigurations I
wanted to manage. Inside each of those directories, I moved in all the
appropriate files, maintaining the directory structure of my home directory. So,
if a file normally resides at the top level of your home directory, it would go
into the top level of the program's subdirectory. If a file normally goes in the
default <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/${PKGNAME}</code> location (<code>${HOME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code>), 
then it would instead go in <code>${HOME}/dotfiles/${PKGNAME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code> and 
so on. Finally, from the <code>dotfiles</code> directory, you just run <code>$ stow $PKGNAME</code>
and Stow will symlink all the package's configuration files to the appropriate
locations. It's then easy to make the <code>dotfiles</code> a VCS repository so you can
keep track of changes you make (plus it makes it so much easier to share
configurations between different computers, which was my main reason to do it).</p>

<p>For example, let's say you want to manage the configuration for Bash, VIM and
Uzbl. Bash has a couple files in the top-level directory; VIM typically has your
.vimrc file on the top-level and a .vim directory; and Uzbl has files in
<code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/uzbl</code> and <code>${XDG_DATA_HOME}/uzbl</code>. So, your home directory
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    brandon/
        .config/
            uzbl/
                [...some files]
        .local/
            share/
                uzbl/
                    [...some files]
        .vim/
            [...some files]
        .bashrc
        .bash_profile
        .bash_logout
        .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>You would then create a <code>dotfiles</code> subdirectory and move all the files there:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    /brandon/
        .config/
        .local/
            .share/
        dotfiles/
            bash/
                .bashrc
                .bash_profile
                .bash_logout
            uzbl/
                .config/
                    uzbl/
                        [...some files]
                .local/
                    share/
                        uzbl/
                            [...some files]
            vim/
                .vim/
                    [...some files]
                .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>Then, perform the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ stow bash
$ stow uzbl
$ stow vim
</code></pre>

<p>And, voila, all your config files (well, symbolic links to them) are
all in the correct place, however disorganized that might be, while
the actual files are all neatly organized in your <code>dotfiles</code>
directory, which is easily turned into a VCS repo. One handy thing is
that if you use multiple computers, which may not have the same
software installed on them, you can pick and choose which
configurations to install when you need them. All of your dotfiles are
always available in your <code>dotfiles</code> directory, but if you don't need
the configuration for one program, you simply don't Stow it and thus
it does not clutter your home directory.</p>

<p>Well, that's all there is to it. Hopefully someone else out there
finds this useful! I know I've found it to be a huge help.</p>
