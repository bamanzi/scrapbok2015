<p>Let’s say you have a program that needs to do I/O on a terminal (it
draws really nice ascii graphics!), but it usually runs
unsupervised. If the program crashes, you want a think like
<a href="http://skarnet.org/software/s6/">s6</a> or
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a> to
restart that program. The problem here is the terminal I/O: Since most
process supervision tools usually redirect standard I/O to a log file,
the wonderful terminal graphics just end up being non-ascii chunder
that confuses you if you try to tail the log file.</p>

<p>My usual approach would have been to start the program under screen
(<code>screen -D -m</code> if you’re interested), but that way you lose part of
your process supervision tools’ capabilities: There’s a process in
between the supervisor and your actual program, so you can’t send
e.g. <code>SIGKILL</code> with your standard tools (e.g., <code>svc -k
/svc/your-tool</code>) to force it to exit.</p>

<p>However, this approach is generally what I want – I’d like the crashy
program to run under a pseudo terminal like screen to have its I/O be
available elsewhere, and also make the pseudo-terminal’ed process be a
direct child of the process supervisor. One feels reminded of a cake
that is had &amp; eaten.</p>

<p>I searched up and down, and besides
<a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/215071">some djb announcement</a> in the
early 90s of a tool that <em>might</em> be made to do what I want (which
doesn’t compile under modern OSes anymore, and is also fantastically
underdocumented), I didn’t find anything. <code>screen -Dm</code> was my best
bet, but ugh! Time to see if we can do something hilarious with UNIX
semantics. Spoiler: We <strong>totally</strong> can.</p>

<h2 id="first-pseudo-terminals-how-do-they-work">First: Pseudo Terminals - how do they work?</h2>

<p>Pseudo Terminals (aka pseudo TTYs or PTYs) are a fun and kinda
horrible facility in UNIX: A process can allocate a PTY, and gets a
controlling and a client end<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. If you’re writing a
terminal-emulation program like xterm, it would keep the controlling
end - this is what allows it to read what’s being written to the
client end and send text to the client, as if that text appeared in a
real terminal. Your terminal emulator would pass the client end to a
shell session and then read what the shell sends to stdout or
stderr.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The one thing you really need to know about PTYs here is that the
controlling and the client end both come as UNIX file
descriptors. They’re a number attached to a process, much like file
handles, sockets or other silly things you can use with
<code>read</code>/<code>write</code>.</p>

<p>So, my thinking goes: Let me write a little UNIX tool that sets up a
new PTY, then sends the controlling end to another process, then
retains the client end for itself and calls <code>exec</code> to start my crashy
program. Calling <code>exec</code> doesn’t adjust the process hierarchy, and
would be exactly what other tools do to start programs under process
supervision.</p>

<h2 id="if-only-there-was-a-way-to-send-that-controlling-end-elsewhere">If only there was a way to send that controlling end elsewhere…</h2>

<p>But… uh, can you send the controlling end of a PTY to another
process? Turns out you can!</p>

<p>UNIX domain sockets<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> are what they call a socket facility (“Internet”
is another socket facility). These are file-like objects that behave
almost exactly like real network sockets to localhost - they have two
ends, you can send and receive data via <code>sendmsg</code> and <code>recvmsg</code>, but
they have a few more functions! One is that one end can query the
other end’s user ID and other authentication data.</p>

<p>Another cool function of UNIX domain sockets is that you can send
structured data like file descriptors over them. Remember file
descriptors? Both ends of a PTY are file descriptors!</p>

<p>Yay! Just send the controlling end of the PTY through a UNIX domain
socket to a process that’s running under a terminal emulator like
screen! We can do this!</p>

<h2 id="oh-right-prior-art-introducing-deptyr">Oh right: Prior art &amp; introducing deptyr!</h2>

<p>My amazing colleague Nelson had already written a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr">reptyr</a>, which did the things I
wanted to do, just almost in inverse: It uses <code>ptrace</code> to attach to a
process that’s running under another terminal and force it to set up a
new PTY, it then makes the process send the controlling end to reptyr
through a UNIX domain socket so it can proxy your input and the
process’s output.</p>

<p>Since reptyr’s code base is geared towards doing just that re-PTY-ing
of existing programs (it’s really not my pun), I decided to rearrange
it in a new tool for starting processes headlessly, called
<a href="https://github.com/antifuchs/deptyr">deptyr</a>.</p>

<p>Deptyr has two modes of operation: One is to act as the “head”: It’s
the thing that receives the controlling end of a PTY and acts as a
proxy for your program’s output &amp; any user input.</p>

<p>The other mode is the one that runs under process supervision - it
sets up a PTY, connects to the “head” deptyr, and then execs your
program with stdin/stdout redirected.</p>

<p>Once I’ve got the original thing thing I wanted to work, I’ll post an
update with the config I used to actually run it under
supervision. Initial experiments point to yes, but we’ll see (-:</p>

<li id="fn:1">the standard terminology for the controlling and client end is is the “master” and “slave” ends. I find the standard terms extremely distasteful; in addition to extreme lack of taste, they don’t even correctly convey what’s going on, so controlling/client ends it is.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:1">↩</a></li>
<li id="fn:2">This is what tools like screen and xterm do! It’s pretty interesting to learn about this in detail – it’s pretty easy to run into a situation where you want to control a tool like a terminal emulator would. Sadly, I don’t know a lot of literature on PTYs. <a href="mailto:asf@boinkor.net">Send me</a> your favorites!
